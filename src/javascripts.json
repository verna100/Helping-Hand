As you progress in coding you'll learn that for cleaner, more readable code you use a separate file saved as a .js file (milkshake.js). You take your current HTML which we will call iceCream.HTML and add a script tag referring to your Javascript file known as (milkshake.js). That simple you now have the necessary tools to take your iceCream(HTML) and turn it into a milkShake(javascript)."
