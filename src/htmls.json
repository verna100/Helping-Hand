These are ranked from largest (1) to smallest (6) heading sizes.  <p> are used to identify paragraphs. <a> tags are used to identify weblinks. You surround web page addresses with <a href='insert web address here'></a>, and this will display a clickable link to that page.  <img> allows you to add images to your web page. These are the basics needed to create your first webpage.  There are others like <div> and <span> but those I will discuss in more detail",
